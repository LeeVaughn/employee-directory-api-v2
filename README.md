# Employee Directory API

Uses the Random User Generator API to create an employee directory for Awesome Startup.

## Motivation

This is the fifth project in the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program (version 2). I build the original version
using Bootstrap but for practice I decided to build it again without using Bootstrap.

## Features

* Requests a JSON object from the Random User Generator API
* Parses that data to display 12 random employees from the list
* Information displayed includes thumbnail image, full name, email address, and location
* Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as username, date of birth, and address
* User can move through the different modal windows using prev and next buttons
* User can search for specific employees by either name or username

## Future Improvements

* Disable prev and next buttons on the first and last modal windows
* Restrict modal windows after search to only show those employees who match the search term
